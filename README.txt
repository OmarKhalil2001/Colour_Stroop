Colour Stroop is simple puzzle game for mobile phones. The game uses
the stroop effect to create a fun and engaging challenge for users. The game
also uses in-game currency of keys to revive users once he/she loses. The game 
also has multiple ranks and gets progressively harder as you rank up.

The game was built using HTML, CSS, JQuery, JavaScript, and Processing.Js. I used HTML and CSS
for basic structure and design, JavaScript for user interaction and gameplay, JQuery for basic animations, and
Processing.JS for leveling-up animations. I also used Adobe PhoneGap to turn the website into
an Android Application, and Posted it on Google Play Store.
